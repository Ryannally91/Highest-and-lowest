Another challenge from Codewras:

"In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number."

This involved first converting the string into an array.  To do this I used the split method.  Then I iterated through to convert the string into an int. 
max and min values would update as the loop continued.
